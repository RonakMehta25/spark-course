Creation of RDD

There are three ways to create RDD

1. Parallelized

sc.parallelize(1 to 100,5).collect

sc.parallelize(Array(1,2,3,4,5))

Here the second argument is number of partition. 

Remember Number of task is equals to Number of partition


2. From other RDD (map,filer)

3. From other source like file ,hbase ,table

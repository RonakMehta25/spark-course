Transformation

Two Types of Transformation

1. Narrow Transformation :

Data needed to compute the result lives in the same partition

eg map,filter

2. Wide Transformation

Data needed to compute the result may live in different partition and thus there can be lot of data shuffle across the network.

eg Join,Union,groupBy,reduceBy,distinct,intersection,coalesce,sortByKey

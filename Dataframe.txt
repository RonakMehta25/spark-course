Dataframe

DataFrame is a Dataset organised into named columns. 

It is conceptually equivalent to a table in a relational database.

So, a DataFrame has additional metadata due to its tabular format, which allows Spark to run certain optimizations on the finalized query.

You can convert to RDD using rdd method

val rowsRdd: RDD[Row] = df.rdd()

and from rdd to Dataframe using toDF()

def createDataFrame(RDD, schema: StructType (Optional)).toDF("new1","new2")

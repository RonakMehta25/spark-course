Cluster Manager Types
The system currently supports several cluster managers:

Standalone – a simple cluster manager included with Spark that makes it easy to set up a cluster.
Apache Mesos – a general cluster manager that can also run Hadoop MapReduce and service applications.
Hadoop YARN – the resource manager in Hadoop 2.
Kubernetes – an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
